description: 'The Shelf2Life Mountaineering Collection provides a unique glimpse into
  the history and evolution of mountaineering through the late 19th and early 20th
  centuries. From historical maps, first-hand accounts of early summits, descriptions
  of peaks and wilderness areas to detailed mountaineering proofs, enthusiasts can
  now experience the thrill of the greatest peaks as they were in the early part of
  the century. Further, in-depth discussions of traditional equipment, technique and
  routes are a fascinating study in the evolution of the sport. Given the recent explosion
  of interest in mountaineering, these books are an excellent opportunity to revisit
  the roots and origins of the sport: they offer a valuable historical perspective
  as well as important information about the landscape and geography of the past.'
